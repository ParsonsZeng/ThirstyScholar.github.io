# Thirsty Scholar's Deep Thinking



1. **BP** (Backpropagation)

   - Backpropagate a Two-Layered Neural Network from Scratch
     - Show the math and code behind the backpropagation algorithm of a two-layered feedforward neural network.

   ​

2. **Spiral** (Spiral Dataset Classification)

   - From Scratch: Training a Neural Network to Classify Spiral Datasets

     - Train a two-layered neural network *from scratch* in Numpy. Good practice to test the understanding of backpropagation and its implementation without using high-level neural netowrk libraries.
     - Add test data.
     - Add validation on hyper-parameters.

   ​

3. **LR** (Linear Regression)

   - Train a linear regression model to fit a 1-dimensional data.

   ​

4. **RNN** (Recurrent Neural Network)

   - Train a *recurrent neural network* to predict $\sin(t)$ with $\cos(t)$ using PyTorch.

     ​

5. **CartPole** (OpenAI Gym)

   - Solve the CartPole task by *reinforcement learning*.
     - REINFORCE
     - PGPE
