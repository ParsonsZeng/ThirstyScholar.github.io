# Thirsty Scholar's Deep Thinking



1. **BP** (Backpropagation)

   - Backpropagate a Two-Layered Neural Network from Scratch
     - Show the math and code behind backpropagation of a two-layered feedforward neural network.

   ​

2. **Spiral** (Spiral Dataset Classification)

   - From Scratch: Training a Neural Network to Classify Spiral Datasets

     - Train a two-layered neural network from scratch. Good practice to test understanding of backpropagation and implement it without using high-level neural netowrk libraries.

   ​

3. **LR** (Linear Regression)

   - Train a linear regression model to fit a 1-dimensional data.

   ​

4. **RNN** (Recurrent Neural Network)

   - Train a recurrent neural network to predict $\sin(t)$ using $\cos(t)$ with PyTorch.

     ​

5. **CartPole** (OpenAI Gym)

   - Solve the CartPole task by *reinforcement learning*.
     - REINFORCE
     - PGPE
