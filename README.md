# Thirsty Scholar's Deep Thinking

1. BP (Backpropagation)

   - [Backpropagate a Two-Layered Neural Network from Scratch](file:///Users/ChienYiHuang/ThirstyScholar.github.io/BP/bp.html)
     - Show the math and code behind backpropagation of a two-layered feedforward neural network.

2. spiral (Spiral Dataset Classification)

   - [From Scratch: Training a Neural Network to Classify Spiral Datasets](https://github.com/ThirstyScholar/ThirstyScholar.github.io/blob/master/Spiral/spiral.md)

     Train a two-layered neural network from scratch. Good practice to test understanding of backpropagation and implement it without using high-level neural netowrk libraries.

3. CartPole (OpenAI Gym)

   Solve the CartPole task by *reinforcement learning*.

   - REINFORCE
   - PGPE
